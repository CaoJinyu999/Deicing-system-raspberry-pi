Deicing-system-raspberry-pi
=============

## Idea
  
  ### In the winder of Glasgow, Our team found roads always ice up. Some people slip on roads because of ice and snow. So we decide to construct a system to prevent these accidents.
  
## Target of this project  
  
 Â ###  This project aims to remove the ice or snow by brine. By using the humidity and temperature sensor to detect the environment. The sprinkler is used to spread saline water and controlled by Raspberry Pi. Another sensor is IR sensor that is used to detect walkers and animals. When it detects people, the sprinkler will turn off.
